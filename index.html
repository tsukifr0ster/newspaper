        <p>Amid incessant rainfall in the Delhi-NCR region, the Yamuna water level in the national capital once again breached the danger mark on Thursday. The water level of Yamuna river was recorded at 205.98 meters at 4 pm on Thursday. Earlier in the day, it was recorded at 205.83 meters at 10:00 am, officials said. The danger mark of the Yamuna is 205.33 meters. On Tuesday, Yamuna's water level in Delhi dropped below the danger mark, recorded at 205.32 metres at 7 pm. In the NCR, the water level of the Hindon river also rose flooding several low-laying areas and floodplains of Noida. An area near Ecotech 3 in Noida got submerged following the surged water level due to which many vehicles got stuck in the water.</p>

        <p>The rise in water levels of both Yamuna and Hindon has been a matter of concern as it has led to a flood-like situation in the national capital and adjoining regions. The Yamuna water level had been hovering around the danger mark of 205.33 metres for the last few days after reaching an all-time high of 208.66 metres on July 13. While floodplains along Hindon and Yamuna rivers were impacted, waterlogging was also reported in several areas and roads in Noida and Greater Noida. On July 26, 17 villages were affected due to swollen Hindon and Yamuna rivers in Noida and Greater Noida. On Wednesday, the water level of the Yamuna river downstream at Okhla Barrage at 4 pm was 198.25 metres, and the water level of the Hindon river downstream was 201.15 metres, below the danger mark of 205.80 metres.</p>

        <p>The Yamuna waters exceeded the warning mark, and the area around Nigam Bodh Ghat in Delhi was flooded, which caused traffic on the GT Karnal Road in the nation's capital to break down.Yamuna flood waters have risen, flooding low-lying areas, which has made it difficult for traffic to move on Mahatma Gandhi Marg between IP Flyover and Chandgi Ram Akhara, Mahatma Gandhi Marg between Kalighat Mandir and Delhi Secretariat, and Outer Ring Road between Wazirabad Bridge and Chandgi Ram Akhara.The authorities have advised commuters to stay off of these roads and to plan their routes appropriately. Due to a drain overflow near the Railway Under Bridge, Bhairon Road is closed to vehicular traffic.Commercial vehicles will be diverted from Mukarba Chowk, Sarai Kale Khan, Ghazipur border, and from Akshardham towards DNDCommercial vehicles will be detoured away from DND from Akshardham, Sarai Kale Khan, the Ghazipur border, and Mukarba Chowk.No commercial vehicles are permitted between Mukarba Chowk and Wazirabad Bridge, Sarai Kale Khan and IP Flyover, or Akshardham and Sarai Kale Khan, according to the Delhi Traffic Police.The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) had earlier on Wednesday issued a warning for open-air cremation grounds close to the Yamuna River due to the river's rising water levels from nonstop rain. The MCD advised people not to visit the open-air cremation ground and to use another ground instead because there is a chance that water will enter the Nigam Bodh Ghat and impede cremation activities.

      Health risks associated with overflowing of Yamuna in Delhi;</h2>

      <h4 class="heading-4"><u>Risks</u></h4 >
      <p>As the Yamuna River continues to flood the streets of the national capital, public health risks have become a major concern. Experts emphasize the need for adequate attention to be paid to the situation to address potential health issues arising from the floods and stagnant water.

        The flooded areas and stagnant water pose risks such as waterborne diseases, vector-borne diseases, skin infections, and mental health issues. Given Delhi's high pollution levels and the existing challenges faced by the Yamuna River, including frothing, it is highly likely that the floodwaters in the city contain pollutants, sewage, and industrial waste.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="heading-4"><u>Help From The Governmant</u></h4>
      <p>Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced Rs 10,000 as financial aid for every flood-affected family in the national capital. “Many very poor families living on the banks of Yamuna have suffered a lot. In some families, the entire household goods were washed away,” he said. The CM assured that special camps would be organised for those whose papers like Aadhaar cards etc were lost during the floods. He also said that for children whose clothes and books were washed away, will be provided with the same on behalf of the schools.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="heading-4"><u>Precautions</u></h4>
      <p>It is important for individuals and communities to take appropriate precautions during floods, such as avoiding contact with floodwater, practicing good hygiene, seeking medical attention for any injuries or illnesses, and taking care of their mental well-being. Local authorities and relief organizations play a vital role in providing necessary healthcare services and addressing the health concerns during and after floods.</p>
